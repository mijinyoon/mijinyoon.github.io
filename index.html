	<p>I am Mijin Yoon, a researcher investigating the mysteries of the Universe. For example, why the level of matter clumpiness is estimated lower in the late Universe than in the early Universe (see <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v16/193"my article><\a>). I work on cosmological studies mainly focused on large-scale structures in the Universe at scales of galaxies and galaxy clusters. My studies involve analyzing a vast volume of survey observation data (e.g. Euclid, KiDS, LSST, DLS, WISE, 2MASS). My main expertise is weak lensing, a great tool to probe dark matter distribution using the shape distortion of background galaxies. Feel free to contact me for collaboration and talk opportunities in your institutions. </p>
