	<p>I am Mijin Yoon, an astrophysicist and cosmologist. Please feel free to contact me for collaboration and talk opportunities in your institutions. I am actively working on small scale studies (e.g. baryonic feedback effect, nonlinear bias, etc.) for cosmological analysis from weak lensing data. I also work on weak lensing analysis with galaxy clusters.</p>
