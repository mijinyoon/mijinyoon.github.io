	<h1>My Story</h1>
	<p>I grew up in Seoul, South Korea. I studied physics in <a href=http://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/>POSTECH</a> for my bachelor degree. I also studied economics, especially science policy for my mater degree in <a href=http://temep.snu.ac.kr/en>Seoul National University</a>. I received my Ph.D. in <a href="https://umich.edu">University of Michigan</a> under <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~huterer/">Dragan Huterer</a> specialized in Cosmology and the large-scale structure.
As Rufus fellow, I worked in <a href=https://devcms.yonsei.ac.kr/galaxy_en/index.do>astronomy department</a> of Yonsei University, Korea on weak lensing studies with the <a href=https://www.noao.edu/survey-archives/deeplens/>Deep Lens Survey (DLS)</a>. Now I am a senior fellow in <a href="https://gccl-rub.github.io">German Center for Cosmological Lensing, </a> based in <a href="https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en">Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum</a>. Currently, I am a member of LSST, Euclid, and the <a href=http://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl>Kilo-Degree Survey</a>.
